            <h1>What is Server Guard?</h1>
            <p>Server Guard is a bot made to protect Guilded servers from trolls, ban evaders, and raids/bots. All users who join the server are asked to verify themselves.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h1>How does Server Guard work?</h1>
            <p>Server Guard works by scanning a user’s Guilded connections for anything suspicious. Server Guard will also perform a check to see if a user’s IP matches a hashed IP of any previously banned user to help protect against ban evasion! We use metrics such as Steam account level or Roblox account age for our checks.</p>

            <h1>What is the Default Role?</h1>
            <p>The Default Role in Server Guard’s context means a role that is given to all members in your server when they join. This role is taken away once the user has verified. The reverse can also be done, so that it acts like a verification role instead.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h1>What are the Admin and Mod roles?</h1>
            <p>These are roles you can add to the bot which give access to permissions within the bot. They are both near identical, with the only difference being that Admins can change the bot’s settings, while Mods are unable to.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h1>What are the verification and log channels?</h1>
            <p>The log channel is where Server Guard will log the status of new users going through verification. The bot needs a place for new users to verify/be notified of the need to verification, which the verification channel is for. The verification channel should be the only channel an unverified user can interact with or see and is required.</p>
